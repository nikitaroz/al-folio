  abstract = {Fluorescent proteins have emerged as an essential toolset for bioimaging, creating a demand for engineering proteins with new and improved fluorescent properties. In this thesis, I explore the atomistic structure of REX-GECO1, a newly engineered protein biosensor that has unique optical properties. Since this protein has no available crystal structure, understanding the relationship between its structure and properties is difficult. To overcome this challenge, I use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the protein's structure and use this information to identify structural features that influence fluorescence. Moreover, I use the simulations to obtain thermodynamic information that provides further detail about the protein. These findings will be useful for understanding data obtained from ongoing ultrafast spectroscopic studies.},

  abstract = {We, the AIChEs and Pains, completed the design for a facility capable of producing 1000 kg of a monoclonal antibody proteins annually. Per our calculations, our design will require a direct fixed capital cost of \$38 million to complete construction of the plant. The annual operating cost for the plant will be \$58 million. Competitor antibody manufacturers have a selling price point of around \$5 million per kilogram of antibodies. Using this figure, the annual revenue for the plant will be around \$4.9 billion. We believe further verification is required to determine the accuracy of this costing calculation. We recommend proceeding with a more detailed design after the costing calculations are verified and more accurately determined.},
