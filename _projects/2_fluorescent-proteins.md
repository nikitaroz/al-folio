Check out these cool fluorescent jellyfish!

Besides being fun to look at, these jellyfish have important scientific applications due to their fluorescent behavior. Green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is extracted from this jellyfish, is used for to imaging cells and organisms, which helps us scientists track cellular bio-mechanics, which is invaluable for understanding how to treat a host of different diseases.

At the Fang Lab at Oregon State University, I delved into how these fluorescent proteins behave, and how we could make alterations that would improve them.
