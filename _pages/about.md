I am an Oregon State Chemical Engineering and Physics graduate. My interests are in using software and machine learning to make an impact. After graduation I worked at Intel Corporation in the manufacturing research and development department for three years. Recently, I joined Amazon.com as a System Development Engineer, focusing on network automation. I am excited to showcase the research and projects from my undergraduate and beyond. I also include some of my artwork from pervious years.
